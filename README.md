# Book Predictor

Overview
The Book Predictor is a simple Python-based machine learning tool designed to recommend books similar to a given input book. It leverages basic text processing and similarity measurement techniques to find books with descriptions similar to the user's input.

Features
Book Recommendation: Provides a list of all the books with descriptions similar to the input book.
Text Vectorization: Converts book descriptions into numerical vectors using a count-based approach.
Cosine Similarity: Measures similarity between books to generate recommendations.
Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas
Usage
Prepare the Dataset: Update the data dictionary with your own book dataset. The dataset should include title and description for each book.

Run the Script: Execute the Python script to get book recommendations. The script uses a simple text vectorization method to process book descriptions and calculates similarity to recommend books.

python
Copy code
# Example usage
input_book = 'Book A'
print(f"Books similar to '{input_book}':")
print(recommend_books(input_book))
Function Description:
text_to_vector(text): Converts book descriptions to numerical vectors.
recommend_books(input_book_title): Returns titles of books similar to the input book.
Example
If you provide "Book A" as the input book, the script will output a list of books that have similar descriptions to "Book A".

Notes
This project uses a basic count-based approach for text vectorization and cosine similarity for recommendation. For more accurate recommendations, consider using advanced text processing and similarity techniques.
The dataset is currently hardcoded; you can modify the data dictionary to include your own books.
